# Market Intelligence

Framework for gathering, scoring, and acting on market intelligence. This skill powers the `/autonoma:trends` command and informs strategic decisions.

## Research Methodology

### Multi-Source Approach

Never rely on a single source. Cross-reference across:

1. **Industry publications** — TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Information, Hacker News
2. **Social signals** — LinkedIn discussions, Twitter/X threads, Reddit communities
3. **Company announcements** — product launches, funding rounds, partnerships
4. **Data sources** — market reports, survey results, benchmark studies
5. **Community sentiment** — forum discussions, GitHub stars/issues, developer surveys

### Finding Scoring System

Every finding gets scored on three axes:

| Metric | Scale | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Relevance** | 0.0-1.0 | How directly does this affect our market/audience? |
| **Materiality** | 0.0-1.0 | Is this genuinely new and important, or just noise? |
| **Confidence** | 0.0-1.0 | How well-supported is this finding? Multiple sources? |

**Inclusion threshold**: relevance >= 0.5 AND materiality >= 0.5

**Priority score**: relevance x materiality x confidence (0.0-1.0)

### Filtering Noise

Most "trends" are noise. Apply these filters:

- **Recency**: Is this actually new, or a rehash of old news?
- **Specificity**: "AI is growing" is noise. "$13B market, 45.8% CAGR" is signal.
- **Actionability**: Can we do something with this information?
- **Credibility**: Who is the source? Primary data > opinion pieces.

## Competitor Analysis Framework

When analyzing competitors, structure the analysis as:

### Direct Competitors (same category)
- What are they doing that we should know about?
- What are their customers complaining about? (opportunities)
- What's their pricing strategy?
- What content are they publishing?

### Adjacent Competitors (different category, same audience)
- What can we learn from their approach?
- Where do our audiences overlap?
- Potential collaboration opportunities?

### Market Shifts
- New entrants that could disrupt?
- Technology changes that affect everyone?
- Regulatory changes?
- Audience behavior shifts?

## From Intelligence to Action

Every research session should produce:

1. **Content topics** — what should we write about based on trends?
2. **Strategic insights** — do we need to change our approach?
3. **Timing signals** — what's urgent vs. can wait?
4. **Competitive gaps** — what isn't anyone else covering?
