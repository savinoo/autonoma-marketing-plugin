# Brand Voice

These are the default brand voice guidelines. **Customize this file** to match your brand — every field below should reflect YOUR company's voice, not Autonoma's.

## Identity

- **Company**: Autonoma
- **Author/Founder**: Lucas Lorenzo Savino
- **Role**: AI/Agentic Engineer — building an AI-operated company

## Tone

Technical but accessible. Confident without arrogance. Personal experiences over generic advice.

Write like you're explaining something to a smart colleague over coffee — not like a corporate press release, and not like a textbook. Lucas is a hands-on engineer who builds with AI agents daily. The content comes from real experience building and running Autonoma, not from reading about AI.

## Words to NEVER Use

These words signal AI-generated content and erode trust:

"delve", "leverage", "utilize", "comprehensive", "innovative", "cutting-edge", "game-changer", "paradigm shift", "synergy", "holistic", "robust", "streamline", "empower", "revolutionize", "disrupt"

If you catch yourself using any of these, replace with a simpler, more specific word.

## Writing Principles

1. **First-person stories and specific examples** — "Last week I built X and it failed because Y" beats "One should consider the implications of Z"
2. **Numbers and concrete results over vague claims** — "Reduced API calls by 73%" beats "Significantly improved performance"
3. **Short paragraphs** — 1-2 sentences for LinkedIn, 2-3 for blog posts
4. **Questions that spark discussion** — End posts with genuine questions, not rhetorical ones
5. **Honest admissions of what didn't work** — Vulnerability builds trust faster than perfection

## Target Audience

Tech professionals, startup founders, AI engineers, CTOs interested in AI agents and automation. People who want to understand how to build with AI — not just use it.

Adjust the technical depth based on platform:
- **LinkedIn**: Accessible to semi-technical audience (explain acronyms, give business context)
- **Twitter/X**: Tech-savvy audience (can use jargon, show code snippets)
- **Blog**: Mix of technical and business audience (deep dives welcome)
- **Email**: Segmented by interest level

## Content Topics

Core themes to build authority around:
- AI agents in production (real architectures, not theory)
- Multi-agent systems (orchestration, quality gates, parallel execution)
- RAG and LLM applications (practical implementations)
- Building an AI-operated company (build in public — Autonoma's story)
- Claude Code, Cowork, and the agentic ecosystem
- Lessons from failures and what actually works

## Formatting Standards

### LinkedIn
- Hook in first line (before "see more" fold)
- Line break between every 1-2 sentences
- NO external links in post body (kills reach by 40%+)
- Link goes in first comment
- 3-5 hashtags at the very end
- Optimal length: 1200-1500 characters

### Twitter/X
- Thread format for long-form (numbered tweets)
- First tweet must hook immediately
- Each tweet: max 280 chars, self-contained but connected
- Last tweet: summary + CTA

### Blog
- H2 every 200-300 words
- TL;DR at the top
- Include at least one image, diagram, or code snippet
- Internal links to related content

### Email
- Subject line < 50 characters
- Preview text complements (doesn't repeat) subject
- One clear CTA per email
- Mobile-first formatting

## Autonoma's Story (use for authenticity)

Autonoma is an AI-operated company where Lucas (CEO) defines strategic goals and AI agents execute everything: marketing, development, deployment. The company has:
- 12+ specialized AI agents across Marketing and Dev departments
- A peer-review quality system where agents critique each other's work
- Parallel execution (multiple Builder agents working simultaneously)
- CEO interrupt gates at critical decision points

This story IS the content. "Building in public" about how Autonoma works is the most powerful marketing asset.
