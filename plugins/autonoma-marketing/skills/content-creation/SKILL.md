# Content Creation

Guidelines for creating high-quality marketing content across platforms.

## Content Types

### LinkedIn Post
1. **Hook** (first line) — create curiosity, tension, or surprise. This line decides whether anyone reads further.
2. **Body** (5-10 short paragraphs) — one idea per paragraph. Use line breaks generously. Mix statements with questions.
3. **CTA/Close** — end with a question that invites comments or a clear call to action.
4. **Hashtags** — 3-5 relevant hashtags at the very end.

Constraints:
- 1200-1500 characters optimal (before "see more" fold is ~210 chars)
- NO external links in body text (put in first comment)
- First person, personal voice
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)

### Twitter/X Thread
1. **Tweet 1** — the hook. Must stand alone. Must stop the scroll.
2. **Tweets 2-N** — each tweet is a self-contained point that also connects to the narrative
3. **Last tweet** — summary + CTA (follow, retweet, reply)

Constraints:
- 280 characters per tweet
- Number each tweet (1/, 2/, etc.)
- 5-12 tweets is the sweet spot
- Include 1-2 tweets with concrete data/numbers

### Blog Post
1. **Title** — benefit-driven, includes primary keyword, under 60 characters
2. **TL;DR** — 2-3 sentence summary at the top
3. **Introduction** — hook + what the post covers (100-150 words)
4. **Body** — 3-5 sections with H2 headers, one core idea per section
5. **Conclusion** — key takeaways + CTA (75-100 words)
6. **Meta description** — under 160 characters with primary keyword

Constraints:
- 800-2000 words
- H2 every 200-300 words
- Include data, examples, or quotes in every section
- At least one visual (diagram, screenshot, code snippet)

### Email Newsletter
1. **Subject line** — under 50 chars, creates curiosity or states clear value
2. **Preview text** — complements (doesn't repeat) the subject
3. **Body** — 2-3 scannable sections with bold intro sentences
4. **CTA** — one clear action, visually distinct

### Landing Page
1. **Hero** — headline (primary benefit, <10 words) + subheadline + CTA
2. **Value props** — 3-4 benefit-driven sections
3. **Social proof** — testimonials, logos, stats
4. **Objection handling** — FAQ or trust signals
5. **Final CTA** — repeat primary call to action

## Hook Formulas

These work across all platforms:

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Surprising stat | "73% of AI projects fail. Here's why the other 27% succeed." |
| Contrarian take | "Stop optimizing your prompts. Start optimizing your architecture." |
| Personal failure | "I spent 3 weeks building something nobody wanted. Here's what I learned." |
| Bold claim | "One AI agent replaced our entire QA process. Here's how." |
| Question | "What if your marketing could run itself while you sleep?" |
| Specific number | "I cut our API costs from $2,400/mo to $0. Here's the exact setup." |

## Engagement Mechanics

### Questions that drive comments
- **Opinion poll**: "What's your biggest challenge with X? A, B, or C?"
- **Experience sharing**: "Has anyone else dealt with X? What worked for you?"
- **Prediction**: "Where do you think X will be in 2 years?"
- **Contrarian invite**: "Am I wrong about this? Change my mind."

### CTAs by platform
- **LinkedIn**: "What's your experience with X?" / "Drop a comment if you agree"
- **Twitter**: "RT if useful" / "Follow for more on X" / "Reply with your take"
- **Blog**: "Subscribe for weekly insights" / "Try X for free"
- **Email**: "Reply and tell us" / "Click here to get started"

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

1. **Generic openings**: "In today's fast-paced world..." — INSTANT scroll-past
2. **Buzzword salad**: "Leveraging cutting-edge AI to synergize..." — loses all credibility
3. **No specific examples**: "Many companies are using AI" — so what?
4. **Wall of text**: No line breaks, no structure — unreadable on mobile
5. **Weak CTAs**: "Let me know what you think" — too passive
6. **Link in LinkedIn body**: Kills reach by 40%+ due to algorithm penalty
7. **Too many hashtags**: More than 5 looks spammy
8. **Self-promotional without value**: "Check out our amazing product!" — nobody cares
