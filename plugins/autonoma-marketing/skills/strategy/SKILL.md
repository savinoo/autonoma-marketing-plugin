# Content Strategy

Framework for strategic content planning that connects business goals to specific content pieces.

## Content Pillar Framework

### What Are Content Pillars?
3-5 core themes that ALL content maps back to. Every piece of content should clearly belong to one pillar.

### Good Pillar Characteristics
- **Directly supports a business goal** (not just "interesting")
- **Has depth** — can generate 10+ unique pieces of content
- **Resonates with target audience** — solves their problems or satisfies their curiosity
- **Differentiates** — not the same thing everyone else covers
- **Measurable** — you can track engagement per pillar

### Pillar Definition Template

For each pillar, define:

```
Name: [Short, memorable label]
Goal: [Which business goal does this support?]
Audience need: [What problem does this solve for the reader?]
Keywords: [3-5 target keywords]
Content types: [Which formats work best for this pillar?]
Frequency: [How often to publish in this pillar?]
```

## Editorial Calendar

### Weekly Calendar Structure

A good weekly calendar balances:
- **Pillar coverage** — each pillar gets at least 1 piece/week
- **Platform diversity** — don't put all content on one platform
- **Content type mix** — alternate between posts, articles, threads
- **Effort distribution** — mix quick pieces (15 min) with deep pieces (2+ hours)

### Calendar Entry Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Topic | Specific enough to start writing immediately |
| Platform | Where this will be published |
| Content Type | Post, article, thread, newsletter |
| Pillar | Which content pillar it belongs to |
| Angle | What makes THIS piece unique? |
| Target Keyword | Primary SEO keyword |
| CTA | What action readers should take |
| Priority | 1-10 (impact x urgency) |
| Scheduled Date | When to publish |
| Status | Planned, In Progress, In Review, Published |

### Prioritization Matrix

Score each piece on two axes:

**Impact** (1-5):
- 5 = Directly drives revenue or major audience growth
- 3 = Builds brand awareness and authority
- 1 = Nice-to-have, minimal business impact

**Effort** (1-5):
- 5 = Full day of work (deep research, long-form)
- 3 = 1-2 hours (standard post with research)
- 1 = 15-30 minutes (quick take, repurpose)

**Priority = Impact / Effort** — high-impact, low-effort pieces go first.

## Data-Driven Strategy

### What to Track

| Metric | Why | Action if Low |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| Engagement rate | Content resonance | Change topics or hooks |
| Follower growth | Audience building | More shareable/discoverable content |
| Comments quality | Audience fit | Adjust content depth or targeting |
| Click-through | CTA effectiveness | Test different CTAs |
| Save/bookmark rate | Long-term value | More "reference" content |

### Analytics to Strategy Loop

```
Publish content
    → Measure performance (1 week)
    → Identify patterns (what works, what doesn't)
    → Adjust pillars and calendar
    → Generate new content informed by data
    → Repeat
```

### Common Strategy Mistakes

1. **No pillars** — random content without cohesion
2. **Too many pillars** — dilutes authority (max 5)
3. **Ignoring data** — publishing what YOU want vs what audience wants
4. **All same format** — only LinkedIn posts, no diversity
5. **No CTA** — content without purpose is hobby blogging
6. **Inconsistent frequency** — 5 posts one week, 0 the next destroys momentum
7. **No differentiation** — saying what everyone else says

## Content Flywheel

The ultimate goal is a self-reinforcing cycle:

```
Strategy defines pillars
    → Content gets created (with quality gates)
    → Content gets distributed across platforms
    → Analytics measures what works
    → Intelligence spots new trends
    → Strategy updates pillars and calendar
    → Repeat (each cycle is informed by more data)
```

Each cycle produces better content because it's informed by real performance data, not guesses.
